🛠️ Smart Greenhouse Automation System 🌿
<img src="src/assets/scheme.jpg" alt="Scheme" width="700"/>
🔥 Project Description
This project is a fully autonomous greenhouse management system, designed and built by me at the age of 14. It features:

✅ Automated cucumber watering based on readings from DIY soil moisture sensors
✅ Air temperature monitoring with automatic heater activation when temperatures drop
✅ Fully automated water tank refill system for irrigation needs
✅ Dual microcontroller architecture — Arduino Nano and Arduino Uno, connected via Serial communication to expand analog input capabilities

I personally designed, soldered, and coded the entire system from scratch — from circuit diagrams and hardware to thousands of lines of control logic.

🧩 Technical Highlights
11 DIY analog soil moisture sensors

DS18B20 digital temperature sensor

Dual Arduino setup:

Uno — system brain, controls pumps, heater, windows, and doors (future expansion)

Nano — fully dedicated to reading all analog sensors

Serial communication between Arduino boards — smart architecture to bypass input limitations

Pump and heater control via relay modules

LCD display for real-time status

System protection:

Dedicated power supply with fuse

Separation of control and power circuits

💡 Why This is Awesome
🧠 The entire project was developed by me personally — including circuit design, soldering, and writing complex code for both microcontrollers
🚀 I completed this system at just 14 years old, demonstrating deep understanding of electronics, microcontroller integration, and communication protocols
🌱 The system solves real-world problems — automating plant care, saving time, and improving crop yield
