# 🛠️ Smart Greenhouse Automation System 🌿

![Scheme](src/assets/scheme.jpg)

---

## 🔥 Project Description

**Fully autonomous greenhouse system**, built by me at just **14 years old**.  
It includes:

✅ Automated cucumber watering with DIY soil moisture sensors  
✅ Air temperature control with automatic heater activation  
✅ Automated water tank refill system  
✅ Dual microcontroller setup — *Arduino Nano* + *Arduino Uno*  

I designed, soldered, and coded the entire system myself, including diagrams and control logic.
